# Shoreline documentation

## What's different?

### Files added

``` txt
website # Root directory of your site
└── demo
   ├── intro.md
   └── document.md
└── sidebarsDemo.js
```

#### The `demo` directory

This is where the second instance is located. It can be easily updated to suit your needs.

### Changes to `docusaurus.config.js`

#### Adding the second instance

This was done by adding a `plugins: […]` to `module.exports`.

``` js
(module.exports = { // start of the module.export declaration
[…]

plugins: [
    […]
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',
      {
        id: 'demo',
        path: 'demo',
        routeBasePath: 'demo',
        sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebarsDemo.js'),
        // ... other options
      },
    ],
],

[…]
}); // end of the module-export declaration
```

Note that `demo` and `sidebarsDemo.js` would need to change if you'd like to use a different name.

#### Adding "Demo" to the Navbar

``` js
(module.exports = { // start of the module.export declaration
[…]

navbar: {
    items: [
        […]
        {
            to: '/demo/intro', // To highlight the navbar item, you must link to a document, not a top-level directory
            position: 'left',
            label: 'Demo',
            activeBaseRegex: `/demo/`,
        },
    ],
}

}); // end of the module-export declaration
[…]
```

Here you can change the label from "Demo" to anything of your choice. Note that if you changed the strings in the above `plugins` example, you will need to reflect those changes in the above `navbar` `items` section as well.

### Adding `sidebarsDemo.js`

``` js
const sidebars = {
    […]

    demoSidebars: [
        {
            type: 'autogenerated',
            dirName: '.' // This must remain `.` if your new docs instance is in the base directory
        }
    ],

}
